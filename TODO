Features
-----------------------
Vectorization:
[ ] Delay evaluation of constant runtime expressions governing loop bounds.
[ ] Delay evaluation of dynamic but predictable strides to avoid gather/scatters.
[ ] Gather/Scatter unrolling if maximum distance is known.
[ ] Check if it is safe to use aligned vector instructions.
[ ] Check if the assumed dependencies are real.

Memory:
[ ] Is the access pattern appropriate? (loop interchange, tiling, ...)
[ ] Is it using the right kind of memory? (RAM, HBM, streaming stores, ...)
[ ] Are the pointer/arrays aliased?
[ ] Runtime alignment check.

Compiler:
[ ] Loop level PGO optimization during the same execution.
[ ] Loop level flag tuning.


Language support
------------------------
[ ] Support for C
[ ] Support for C++
[ ] Support for Fortran
[ ] Support for pthreads (including OpenMP)
[ ] Support for MPI libraries
