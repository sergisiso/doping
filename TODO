Fixes
-----------------------
[ ] Reuse library if specialized loop has already been compiled in a previous execution.
[ ] Create specialized fn name with sprintf (Python can generate the statement) to avoid expensive generation during doping Runtime
[ ] Add proper output comparisons into the tests Makefiles


Features
-----------------------
Vectorization:
[D] Delay evaluation of constant runtime expressions governing loop bounds.
[ ] Delay evaluation of dynamic but predictable strides to avoid gather/scatters.
[ ] Gather/Scatter unrolling if maximum distance is known.
[ ] Check if it is safe to use aligned vector instructions.
[ ] Check if the assumed dependencies are real.

Memory:
[ ] Is the access pattern appropriate? (loop interchange, tiling, ...)
[ ] Is it using the right kind of memory? (RAM, HBM, streaming stores, ...)
[ ] Are the pointer/arrays aliased?
[ ] Runtime alignment check.

Compiler:
[ ] Loop level PGO optimization during the same execution.
[ ] Loop level flag tuning.


Language support
------------------------
[D] Support for C
[D] Support for C++
[ ] Support for Fortran
[ ] Support for pthreads (including OpenMP)
[ ] Support for MPI libraries
