Requirements
------------

- Boost headers. Optional but recommended.

  If these are not found on the local system, the configuration
  script will use a subset of Boost headers supplied with this distribution.
  If the supplied Boost headers are used, it will not not be possible to install
  TaskGraph to another location using the 'make install' command.

- libpng library and headers. Only if building on a platform with the Cell Broadband Engine.

  The libpng library is required for the Cell mandelbrot set example.


General Install Instructions
----------------------------

To configure the package:

./configure

The following options may be helpful:

  --prefix=PREFIX           The directory to which to install TaskGraph (See note above about Boost)
  --with-gcc=LOCATION       Set the path of the gcc binary if it isn't detected automatically
  --with-icc=LOCATION       Set the path of the icc binary if it isn't detected automatically
  --with-ppuxlc=LOCATION    Set the path of the ppuxlc binary if it isn't detected automatically
  --with-spugcc=LOCATION    Set the path of the spu-gcc binary if it isn't detected automatically
  --with-spuxlc=LOCATION    Set the path of the spuxlc binary if it isn't detected automatically

To build TaskGraph:

If you want to install the library, headers and example applications to the
location specified with the --prefix option:

make install
