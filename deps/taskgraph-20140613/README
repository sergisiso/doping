Installation
------------
see INSTALL

Getting Started
---------------

- Take a look at the examples directory. 

- In particular the simple subdirectory. Try to run that program: 

  ./addc 1 

  This should print "b = 2"! 

- There are additional examples included in this package, showing various
  algorithms or techniques that the TaskGraph library is best suited
  at. They typically contain a C++ implementation of the algorithm or
  technique, as well as a TaskGraph implementation, for easy comparison of
  speeds. More details on each example can be found in the examples/README
  file.


Problems
--------

- Email Francis Russell (fpr02@doc.ic.ac.uk)
