Here are the instructions for getting a suitable version of ROSE for use
with TaskGraph.  ROSE is an experimental compiler project at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory and has not been released to the public,
due to its pre-release status and use of the proprietary EDG front end.
If you do not have a copy of ROSE and you have the distribution version
of TaskGraph you will find a file "rose-bin.tar.bz2" in the TaskGraph
distribution root directory.  Create a directory to extract this file
to, this will be your ROSE installation prefix.  Then extract the
"rose-bin.tar.bz2" file:

  mkdir rose-bin
  cd rose-bin
  tar xjf /path/to/TaskGraph/rose-bin.tar.bz2

Then you need not follow any more steps in this file -- proceed with
the building of the TaskGraph library.

If you have the internal version of TaskGraph and you wish to use
ROSE, you must obtain the ROSE source archive and unpack it somewhere.
Then apply the patch found in this directory, "ROSE-for-TaskGraph.patch"
with the following commands:

  cd /path/to/ROSE-0.7.9a
  patch -p1 < /path/to/TaskGraph/docs/rose/ROSE-for-TaskGraph.patch

Then to build ROSE execute the following commands:

  cd /path/to/ROSE-0.7.9a
  mkdir ../ROSE-build
  cd ../ROSE-build
  ../ROSE-0.7.9a/configure --prefix=/full/path/to/usr
  make
  make install

These commands will install ROSE to the prefix /full/path/to/usr - be
sure to substitute /full/path/to/usr for the full path to the desired
installation prefix for ROSE.

After installing ROSE you will have to make some fixups to the ROSE
installation prefix directory.  These will be necessary until ROSE is
more polished for general release.  To do this go to the ROSE installation
prefix directory and type:

  /path/to/TaskGraph/docs/rose/ROSE-prefix-fixups.sh

Now proceed with the building of the TaskGraph library.
